# Digital Ant Farm - Product Requirements Document

## Product Overview

**Vision:** Create an immersive, educational simulation that allows users to experiment with ant colony behavior by adjusting biological parameters and observing emergent superorganism dynamics.

**Mission:** Provide an aesthetically pleasing, scientifically-grounded platform for understanding complex biological systems through interactive parameter manipulation.

## Target Audience

- **Primary:** Biology enthusiasts, students, and educators interested in emergent behavior and swarm intelligence
- **Secondary:** Simulation game enthusiasts and casual gamers interested in sandbox-style experiences
- **Tertiary:** Researchers and developers studying agent-based modeling and collective intelligence

## Core Value Proposition

Users can observe how small parameter changes in individual ant behavior create dramatic shifts in colony-level survival strategies, food efficiency, and threat response - bridging the gap between individual agents and emergent collective intelligence.

## Product Goals

### Short-term (MVP)

- Implement core pheromone trail system for food discovery
- Create intuitive parameter adjustment interface
- Establish visual foundation for colony observation

### Medium-term (V2)
- Add threat detection and defense mechanisms
- Implement multiple ant castes (workers, soldiers, nurses)
- Expand pheromone system (danger, help, nest maintenance)
- Add queen ant management and production controls

### Long-term (V3+)
- Multi-colony interactions and competition
- Environmental challenges (seasons, disasters)
- Advanced analytics and data visualization
- Web-based Three.js version for broader accessibility
