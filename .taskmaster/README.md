# Taskmaster-AI for Digital Ant Farm

This directory contains the taskmaster-ai configuration and task management system for the Digital Ant Farm project.

## Overview

Taskmaster-ai is configured to manage the development of the Digital Ant Farm simulation, organized according to the three development phases outlined in the PRD:

- **MVP (Phase 1)**: Core simulation engine, basic ant behaviors, and essential UI
- **V2 (Phase 2)**: Enhanced complexity with caste system and advanced pheromones  
- **V3 (Phase 3+)**: Ecosystem expansion and advanced features

## Configuration

### Categories
- `core-engine`: Core simulation engine components
- `ui-interface`: User interface and controls
- `simulation`: Simulation logic and mechanics
- `visualization`: Graphics and rendering
- `performance`: Optimization and performance improvements
- `documentation`: Documentation and testing
- `deployment`: Setup and deployment tasks

### Priorities
- `low`: Nice-to-have features
- `medium`: Standard priority features
- `high`: Important features for MVP
- `critical`: Essential features that block other development

### Statuses
- `todo`: Not started
- `in-progress`: Currently being worked on
- `review`: Ready for review
- `testing`: In testing phase
- `done`: Completed
- `blocked`: Blocked by dependencies

## Current Tasks

The initial task set includes 12 MVP tasks covering:

1. **Project Setup** (TASK-001): Environment and dependencies
2. **Core Ant System** (TASK-002): Individual ant entity management
3. **Colony Management** (TASK-003): Central colony coordination
4. **Food Sources** (TASK-004): Resource generation and management
5. **Pheromone System** (TASK-005): Ant communication trails
6. **Movement System** (TASK-006): Navigation and pathfinding
7. **Parameter Controls** (TASK-007): Real-time adjustment interface
8. **Statistics Display** (TASK-008): Performance metrics
9. **Simulation Controls** (TASK-009): Play/pause/reset functionality
10. **Visual Rendering** (TASK-010): Graphics and animation
11. **Performance Optimization** (TASK-011): 60 FPS target optimization
12. **Documentation** (TASK-012): Testing and documentation

## Usage

### Viewing Tasks
```bash
# View all tasks
taskmaster list

# View tasks by category
taskmaster list --category core-engine

# View tasks by priority
taskmaster list --priority critical

# View tasks by status
taskmaster list --status todo
```

### Managing Tasks
```bash
# Start working on a task
taskmaster start TASK-002

# Mark task as complete
taskmaster complete TASK-001

# Update task status
taskmaster update TASK-003 --status in-progress

# Add notes to a task
taskmaster note TASK-005 "Pheromone decay rate needs tuning"
```

### Adding New Tasks
```bash
# Add a new task
taskmaster add "Implement ant collision detection" --category core-engine --priority high --phase mvp
```

## Development Workflow

1. **Start with MVP tasks**: Focus on critical and high-priority tasks first
2. **Core engine first**: Complete TASK-002 (Ant Entity) and TASK-005 (Pheromone System) early
3. **UI integration**: Work on parameter controls (TASK-007) after core systems are functional
4. **Performance focus**: Optimize (TASK-011) throughout development, not just at the end
5. **Documentation**: Keep TASK-012 updated as features are completed

## Task Dependencies

Key dependency order for MVP:
1. TASK-001 (Setup) → All other tasks
2. TASK-002 (Ant Entity) → TASK-003, TASK-006, TASK-010
3. TASK-005 (Pheromone) → TASK-006 (Movement)
4. TASK-003 (Colony) → TASK-008 (Statistics)
5. TASK-004 (Food) → TASK-002 (Ant Entity)

## Phase Planning

### MVP (Current Phase)
Focus on completing all 12 MVP tasks to achieve a basic working simulation.

### V2 (Next Phase)
- Enhanced ant behaviors and caste system
- Advanced pheromone types
- Queen ant management
- Threat and defense systems

### V3 (Future Phase)
- Multi-colony interactions
- Environmental dynamics
- Advanced analytics
- Web-based Three.js version

## Notes

- All tasks include subtasks for better granular tracking
- Performance targets: 500+ ants at 60 FPS
- Priority should be given to core simulation mechanics over UI polish in MVP
- Regular performance testing should be integrated into development workflow
